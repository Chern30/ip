AI Tools used Claude CLI

Reflections:
Week 3 
- Its very easy to lose track of what is going on if the effort is not put in to understand the code that is written
- Need to read and verify code manually, or find other commercial products

Week 6
- Still using Claude Code for this. Learning how to integrate MCPs to give extra tools to give the AI
- I think this is still a very niche category of AI. This is still built as a Human Assisting AI, as oppose to a completely Autonomous AI
- Would explore Autonomous Agents and mcp next!
